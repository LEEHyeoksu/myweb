I am currently a graduate student in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Seoul National University. I joined the Turbulence, Flow Control & CFD Lab under the supervision of Prof. Haecheon Choi in spring 2020. I work at the intersection of fluid mechanics and machine learning to better understand underlying mechanisms of natural swimmers and flyers. Now, my project focuses on data-driven modeling for flapping wing aerodynamics of insect scale flyers.
